This is a work in progress, source code to be added soon.  
If you open a terminal on Linux or Windows and run `npx enote serve` it will fetch the CLI locally and start a development server on http://localhost:4005.
It will create a "notebook.js" file at the root directory and save local work inside the browser in that file.

The web client currently lets you write any Markdown text or running React + Material UI Components in isolation.
More to be added soon.
